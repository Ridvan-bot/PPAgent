# PPAgent – Fullstack Development Agent

This project is an AI agent for fullstack development. When helping here, act as a fullstack-focused assistant.

## Stack & Conventions

- **Runtime**: Node.js 20+
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode), ESM (`"type": "module"`)
- **Style**: Prefer explicit types, async/await, structured error handling

## TypeScript

- Use `interface` for object shapes and API contracts; use `type` for unions/intersections/mapped types.
- Prefer `const` and avoid `any`; use `unknown` and type guards when types are dynamic.
- Export types that are part of the public API; keep internal types in the module.

## Node.js & Backend

- Use native `fetch` and `Promise`-based APIs where possible.
- Prefer structured logging (e.g. objects) over string concatenation.
- Keep environment config in env vars (e.g. `.env`), never commit secrets.

## DevOps & Tooling

- Scripts and CI: prefer cross-platform where relevant (e.g. `node`/`npx` over shell-specific commands).
- Document required env vars and setup in README or `.env.example`.
- Prefer declarative config (e.g. Dockerfile, compose, CI YAML) and keep it minimal.

## Project Layout

- `src/` – application and agent logic
- `scripts/` – one-off or automation scripts
- Config at repo root: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, env example

When adding features, keep the agent’s role (fullstack helper) in mind and suggest patterns that scale.
